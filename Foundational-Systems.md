Mastering System Design: From Low-Level to High-Level Solutions 

How do you Identify Concurrency?

Multiple Threads

Shared Resources

Asynchronous Operations

Parallel Execution

How to find maximum degree of concurrency?

Identify the constraints that limit concurrency in your system, such as hardware limitations (e.g., number of CPU cores), software design (e.g., single-threaded vs. multithreaded), and resource availability (e.g., memory, I/O bandwidth).

Parallelizable Tasks

Optimize Task Execution

Concurrency Control Mechanisms > synchronization mechanisms, such as locks, semaphores, and atomic operations, to control access to shared resources and prevent data races.

 

1. Optimize the Flask Backend
Use a Production WSGI Server

Gunicorn (supports threading and worker processes)

uWSGI (customizable worker and threading options)

NGINX vs. WSGI vs. ASGI

Enable Asynchronous Handling with Multiprocessing or Threading

You can offload intensive tasks using Python's concurrent.futures module:

Use ThreadPoolExecutor for IO-bound tasks.

Use ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound tasks. 

Leverage Flask Extensions for Optimization

Flask-Cache or Flask-Caching: Cache responses to reduce repetitive computations.

Flask-Compress: Compress responses to reduce bandwidth usage. // Minimizes response size for faster delivery.

Flask-SocketIO: Use WebSockets for real-time, low-latency updates instead of polling.

2. Optimize Frontend
Minimize HTTP Requests

Combine CSS and JavaScript files.

Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for static assets like Bootstrap, jQuery, etc.

Leverage Asynchronous Requests

Instead of page reloads, use AJAX or Fetch API for smooth and fast data handling

Web Workers

Use Web Workers in JavaScript to offload heavy computations from the main thread

3. Offload Background Jobs
Use Celery with a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) for tasks that don’t need immediate response

If text processing becomes CPU-intensive, integrate Celery with a broker like Redis.

Non-blocking requests: The main Flask app can immediately respond to the user (e.g., "Processing...") while the task runs in the background.

Scalability: You can scale workers independently of the Flask app to handle more tasks.

Task Retries: Celery automatically retries tasks if they fail.

4. Database Optimization
Indexing: Ensure database columns used in filters and joins are indexed.

Connection Pooling: Use SQLAlchemy’s connection pooling:

Optimize Queries

Use ORM features like select_in for bulk data fetches.

Avoid N+1 queries by preloading relationships.

Cache Results

5. Deploy with Scalability in Mind
Horizontal Scaling: Deploy your app on multiple machines or containers.

Load Balancing: Use tools like Nginx, HAProxy, or AWS ELB.

Serve with Nginx + Gunicorn

Scale horizontally with Kubernetes, AWS, or Docker Swarm.

CDNs: Serve static files through CDNs like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront.

6. Security
Protect Endpoints:

OAuth/OpenID Limitations: These protocols authenticate users but don’t inherently protect backend endpoints from misuse.

Load Balancer Exposure: If the app is behind a load balancer, it doesn’t inherently shield against all attack vectors (e.g., DDoS, request manipulation, or unauthorized internal API calls).

Verify Tokens:

Validate access tokens issued by your OAuth provider.

Use libraries like authlib (for Flask) or fastapi.security (for FastAPI) to decode and verify tokens.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Enforce role-based permissions by inspecting claims in the token (e.g., role, scope, or permissions).

Rate Limiting:

Use tools like Flask-Limiter or FastAPI’s middleware to prevent abuse.

API Gateway:

Place an API Gateway (like AWS API Gateway or Kong) in front of your app to handle authentication, rate limiting, and logging.

CORS:

Enforce CORS policies to allow only trusted origins.

HTTPS:

Ensure all traffic to your app passes through HTTPS.

Audit Logs:

Log access and error events for monitoring.

Firewall Rules:

Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious traffic.

 

Celery (Task Queue):
Celery is used to define tasks (functions) that can be executed asynchronously in the background, outside the main Flask app.

Redis (Message Broker):
Redis acts as a message broker, managing the queue of tasks to be processed. When a task is added to the queue, it is stored in Redis until a worker picks it up.

Workers:
Celery workers are separate processes that continuously fetch and execute tasks from the queue. These workers can run on the same server as your Flask app or on a separate machine.

Result Backend (optional):
Celery can store task results in Redis or a database, allowing you to retrieve the result once the task is completed.

 

psutil: To monitor CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage.

cProfile: To profile your Python script and identify performance bottlenecks.

time: To measure execution times for specific code blocks.

tracemalloc: To analyze memory usage.

 

Coroutines and Async Programming

Using event loops (asyncio), asynchronous iterators (__aiter__), and asynchronous context managers.

Working with libraries like aiohttp for async web requests.

(*args, **kwargs)



fetch('/get_video_data', { 
  method: 'POST', 
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', }, 
  body: video=${selectedVideo} }) 
.then(response => response.json()) 
.then(data => { ... }
});
.catch(error => {
  console.error('Error during fetch or processing data:', error);
});
 

The O(n2) searches if only one student knows on which student the pen is hidden. 

The O(n) if one student had the pen and only they knew it. 

The O(log n) search if all the students knew, but would only tell me if I guessed the right side. 

The above O -> is called Big – O which is an asymptotic notation. There are other asymptotic notations like theta and Omega.

Data Parallelism vs. Model Parallelism vs. Pipeline Parallelism vs. Task Parallelism
Primary Strategy: Start with data parallelism for inference using multiple replicas. GCP’s Vertex AI or Cloud Run can automatically scale based on traffic.

Model-Specific Parallelism:

Use pipeline parallelism if the model has distinct vision and text encoding stages.

Explore model parallelism if the model is too large to fit on a single GPU.

Hybrid Parallelism: If handling a high volume of traffic, combine data parallelism (to handle user queries) with pipeline parallelism (to process inputs efficiently).

 

a. Compute (vCPU/GPUs)
LLMs are compute-intensive, so a powerful CPU or edge-compatible GPU is necessary.

Minimum: 8-16 vCPUs for medium-sized LLMs (e.g., 2B-7B parameters).

Optimal: A dedicated GPU like NVIDIA Jetson Orin, Jetson Xavier NX, or AMD Ryzen Embedded GPUs with 512+ CUDA cores for acceleration.

b. Memory (RAM)
The memory requirement scales with model size.

2B-7B parameters: 8-16 GB RAM.

13B+ parameters: 32 GB+ RAM for smooth operation.

Use memory-efficient techniques like quantization or model distillation for edge devices.

c. Storage (I/O)
Models and embeddings can require significant storage.

Minimum: NVMe SSDs (256 GB to 1 TB) for fast read/write speeds.

Consider external drives or cloud offloading for large models.

d. Power Efficiency
Edge devices often have limited power budgets.

Hardware: Look for ARM-based chips (e.g., Jetson Nano) or FPGA solutions optimized for AI inference.

e. Parallelism and Concurrency
Enable multi-threading and batch inference for high concurrency.

Example: Thread pools for parallel requests or GPU parallel processing.

f. Connectivity
Consider network latency and connectivity for hybrid strategies (offloading part of inference to the cloud).

Offline inference: Fully self-contained with model on-device.

Online inference: Hybrid model where lightweight processing occurs on edge, and heavy lifting is deferred to the cloud.
